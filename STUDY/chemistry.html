        <h3>Laws of Chemical Combination</h3>
        <h4>1. Law of conservation of mass</h4>
        The total mass, that is, the sum of the mass of reacting mixture and the products formed remains constant.
        <h4>2. Law of definite proportion</h4>
        We can say that irrespective of its source, origin or its quantity, the per cent composition of elements by weight in a given compound will always remain the same.
        <h4>3. Law of multiple proportion</h4>
        This law states that if two elements combine to form more than one compound, the masses of these elements in the reaction are in the ratio of small whole numbers.
        <h4>4. Law of reciprocal proportion</h4>
        If two different elements combine separately with a fixed mass of a third element, the ratio of the masses in which they do so are either the same as or a simple multiple of the ratio of the masses in which they combine with each other.
        <h4>5. Gay Lussac's law of gaseous volume</h4>
        This law states that when gases are produced or combine in a chemical reaction, they do so in a simple ratio by volume given that all the gases are at the same temperature and pressure.
