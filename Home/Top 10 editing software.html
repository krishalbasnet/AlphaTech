        Ok—so to those of you working with PCs, this one won’t really apply; but
        we’d remiss to leave it off the list. If you’re looking for simplicity
        and elegance, it doesn’t get much better than Apple iMovie. iMovie’s ten
        high-fidelity filters are some of the classiest in the video editing
        game; and if you’re shooting on your iPhone, or have been editing a
        project on your iPad, you can use AirDrop to wirelessly and seamlessly
        transfer your project over to your Mac. One of iMovie’s most coveted
        features is its green-screen, or “chroma-key” tool, which allows you to
        place your characters in exotic locations—Hawaii, say—at a moment’s
        notice. Want to overlay the scene with “Somewhere Over the Rainbow”?
        iMovie ties directly in with iTunes and GarageBand, so you can easily
        implement custom tracks and sounds. When your movie’s finally ready to
        ship, release it into the wild using iMessage, Facebook, YouTube, or any
        other of iMovie’s succinctly connected platforms. <br /><strong
